# Google Security Operations Community Rules

Rules within this directory were created by the Google SecOps team and members
of the [Google Cloud Security Community](https://www.googlecloudcommunity.com/gc/Google-Cloud-Security/ct-p/googlecloud-security).
These rules take advantage of the latest [YARA-L syntax](https://cloud.google.com/chronicle/docs/detection/yara-l-2-0-syntax)
and are provided as examples that can be customized to fit your organization's
unique environment or serve as inspiration for your detection use cases.

The detection logic for many of these rules is quite broad – it is **strongly
discouraged** to enable all of these rules in SecOps without careful review,
testing, and customization.
