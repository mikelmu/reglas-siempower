# Contribution Guide for Google Security Operations Community Rules

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project. This document
contains guidelines for contributors including a style guide for writing YARA-L
rules.

Members of our community may submit YARA-L rule contributions under the
[`rules/community`](https://github.com/chronicle/detection-rules/tree/main/rules/community) directory.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement (CLA). You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your
contribution; this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your
contributions as part of the project. Head over to https://cla.developers.google.com/
to see your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it again.

## How to Contribute

All submissions, including submissions by project maintainers, require review.

Please follow the process below to contribute to this project. We've also
[labeled](https://github.com/chronicle/detection-rules/contribute) some issues
and pull requests with `good-first-issue` to help people who want to contribute.

1.  Sign the [Contributor License Agreement](https://cla.developers.google.com/)
1.  Familiarize yourself with this contribution guide and our rule
    [style guide](STYLE_GUIDE.md). This will increase the likelihood that your
    contributions will be accepted.
2.  Open a new issue under the [Issues](https://github.com/chronicle/detection-rules/issues)
    page of this repo, choose from one of our issue templates, and fill in all
    of the required fields.
3.  Create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)
    using our pull request template and stage your proposed changes.
      * Link your pull request to your related issue using GitHub supported
        [keywords](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue)
4.  Ensure that the tests associated with your pull request complete
    successfully.
5.  When your pull request is ready for review, add the `ready for review`
    label to it
6.  Someone from the Google Cloud Security team will review your pull request.
      * Please collaborate with your reviewer to incorporate feedback &
        suggestions into your proposed changes. For example, if a rule's logic
        needs to be refined or the rule needs to be updated to conform to our
        style guide.
7.  If your proposed changes are approved, your pull request will be merged into
    the `main` branch of this repo.

We try and acknowledge all issues and pull requests within a few working days.

We're happy to collaborate with contributors to make modifications
and help get their contributions accepted. However, there may be instances where
we're unable to accept your contribution. For example, if a rule contains
invalid syntax or its detection use case is too broad or niche to apply to the
environments of other Google SecOps customers.
